# Portfolio

## Description
Task with applying the core skills recently learned in bootcamp to build a portfolio webpage template from scrath. The portfolio will be updated intermittently throughout the course of the bootcamp to showcase my skills, talents, and completed projects. The portfolio will eventually be used as my professional portfolio. 

## User Story

AS AN employer, I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
<li>WHEN I load their portfolio</li>
<li>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</li>
<li>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation</li>
<li>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work</li>
<li>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</li>
<li>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application</li>
<li>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
<li>WHEN I click on the images of the applications</li>
<li>THEN I am taken to that deployed application</li>
<li>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices</li>
<li>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</li>

**Note**: Not all acceptance criteria were met during this challenge. Plan to update acceptance criteria throughout the course of this bootcamp as I aquire new skills and techniques.
